This is a fullstack web application built using **Express.js** (backend) and **React + Vite** (frontend). This README will help you get the app running locally from scratch.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+ recommended)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HenriBranken/coalition-fed
cd coalition-fed
```

**NB: If, at this stage, the Git repo is still private, then please proceed by unzipping the provided `.zip` file.**

### 2. Setup the Backend (Express)

```bash
cd backend

# A clean install
rm -rfv node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Start the backend server
npm start
```

By default, this should run on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### 3. Setup the Frontend (React + Vite)

```bash
cd frontend

# A clean install
npm -rfv node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Start the frontend development server:
npm run dev
```

By default, the frontend should run on:
[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

---

## View the Web App
Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, open your browser and go to:
[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

The React App should be live, and the API requests to `/api` will be proxied to the backend server on port `8000` using Vite's proxy configuration as specified in the `frontend/vite.config.js` file.

---

## Deployment on Render

This fullstack app is deployed to Render.com using a unified deployment setup, where the backend serves the production-ready frontend build.

### 1. Project Structure for Deployment

```bash
project-root/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/               # Express server (Render root)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ package.json       # Main entry point for Render
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/              # React + Vite frontend
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dist/              # Built via `npm run build`
```

### 2. Render Configuration

- **Root Directory**: `backend`
- **Build Command**:

  ```bash
  npm install && cd ../frontend && npm install && npm run build
  ```
  
  Notice that this:
  - Install the backend dependencies (`express`, etcetera)
  - Installs the frontend dependencies (`react`, `vite`, etcetera)
  - Builds the frontend into `frontend/dist`
- **Start Command**:

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
  
  This runs the Express server, which:
  - Serves the built frontend from `../frontend/dist`
  - Handles the API requests under `/api/*`

### 3. Live URL
Once Deployed, the app is accessible from:
[https://coalition-fed.onrender.com/](https://coalition-fed.onrender.com/)

The Express backend serves all the static assets and handles routing using the `index.html` fallback fro React routes, ensuring that client-side routing works in production.

**With this setup, there is no need to deploy the frontend separately - Render.com serves everything from one unified backend.**
